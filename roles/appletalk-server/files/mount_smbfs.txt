When backing up to a samba/SMB share you must manually mount the share locally
 to restore.  This implies you have booted off of recovery media.

# mkdir -p /Volumes/TimeMachine
# mount -t smbfs //<user>@server0/TimeMachine /Volumes/TimeMachine
  - this will prompt you for <user>'s password

Then restore from the mounted SMB share as any other Time Machine restore
